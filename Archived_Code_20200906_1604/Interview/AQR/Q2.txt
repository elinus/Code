New types of cards are trendy. Each type of a card has a distinct ID number greater than or equal to 1, and the cost of each card equals its ID number. For example, card 1 costs one coin, card 5 costs five coins, and so on.

Leanne already has a collection of cards ids, sorted in strictly ascending order. For her birthday, Mike wants to buy her as many cards as he can. He has d coins, and he wants to buy one each of some cards she doesn't already have.

Given the array ids and the number d, your task is to determine how many cards Mike can buy.

Example

For ids = [2, 4, 5] and d = 7, the output should be buyCards(ids, d) = 2.

Since Leanne already has the cards 2, 4, and 5, Mike could buy the cards 1, 3, 6, 7, etc. Since he only has 7 coins, he could buy a maximum of two cards: 1 and 3, or 1 and 6. The cheapest set of three cards would cost 1 + 3 + 6 = 10, which is too expensive for Mike. So the answer is 2.
