1.) Try not to use same raw pointer for creating more than one shared_ptr object 
    because in that case different shared_ptr objects will not get to know that 
    they are sharing the pointer with any other shared_ptr objects.
2.) Don’t create shared_ptr object from memory from stack instead of heap.
